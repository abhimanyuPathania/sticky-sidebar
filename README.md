# sticky-sidebar
sticky-sidebar is a plugin for adding fully responsive sticky sidebars to your pages. On small screens the sidebar adapts and is laid out as sticky navbar. The plugin gives you full control on the responsive behavior.

#### Do I need jQuery?
Nope. Plugin is written in JavaScript and it doesn't matter if you are using jQuery or not.

#### How to use
You can find the plugin documentation, examples and tutorial on the repository page below.

#### A word about browsers
Desktop: IE9+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera

The sticky sidebar runs fine even on IE8. But the mobile navbar layout does not. It will remain as sidebar at all screen sizes.

Mobile: Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, IE.

_I have tested it only on the updated versions of major desktop and mobile browsers. For IE desktop, plugin has been tested for IE8+_
